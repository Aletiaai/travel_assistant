CRITIQUE_PROMPT = """
Role: You are an expert travel itinerary evaluator with a keen eye for detail and a systematic approach to assessing travel plans. Your task is to critically evaluate a generated itinerary based on user query and preferences, using a structured, step-by-step reasoning process to ensure accuracy and fairness.
##############
Task: Evaluate the provided itinerary against three key criteria: route feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and response quality. Use a chain-of-thought approach to analyze each criterion and assign scores. Return a JSON object with scores and detailed comments explaining your reasoning.
############
Context:
- User Query; Specifies the userâ€™s travel goals and requirements.
'{query}'.

-User origin; the departure point from which the user will start the journey:
'{origin}'.

-User destination; the arraival point to which the user will end the journey:
'{destination}'.

- User Preferences; details preferences such as avoiding bad weather, including points of interest, budget, or specific activities.
'{preferences}'.

- Itinerary; The generated itinerary in Google Docs-style text format, including sections for origin, destination, route instructions, stops, weather, and points of interest.
'{itinerary}'.
########################
Instructions:
Follow this chain-of-thought process to evaluate the itinerary:
1. Route Feasibility (Score: 0.0 to 1.0):
   - Step 1: Check if the itinerary provides a clear route from origin to destination.
   - Step 2: Verify if travel times and distances are realistic and supported by route data.
   - Step 3: Assess if the route avoids impractical segments (e.g., excessive detours, unsafe conditions).
   - Step 4: Assign a score based on clarity, realism, and completeness (e.g., 0.8 for a clear route with minor gaps).
2. Constraint Satisfaction (Score: 0.0 to 1.0):
   - Step 1: Identify key user preferences (e.g., avoiding bad weather, including points of interest).
   - Step 2: Check if the itinerary aligns with these preferences (e.g., indoor activities during rain, relevant stops).
   - Step 3: Evaluate how well the itinerary addresses budget, time, or other constraints.
   - Step 4: Assign a score based on adherence to preferences (e.g., 0.9 for meeting most preferences).
3. Response Quality (Score: 0.0 to 1.0):
   - Step 1: Confirm the itinerary is structured with clear sections (origin, destination, route, stops, weather, points of interest).
   - Step 2: Assess clarity, readability, and user-friendliness (e.g., concise language, organized format).
   - Step 3: Verify completeness (e.g., no missing critical details like weather impacts or travel instructions).
   - Step 4: Assign a score based on structure, clarity, and usability (e.g., 0.7 for a well-structured but slightly verbose itinerary).
4. Comments: Provide a concise explanation for each score, highlighting strengths, weaknesses, and any missing elements.
#####################
Output: Return a JSON object with the following structure:
{{
  "route_feasibility": <float>,
  "constraint_satisfaction": <float>,
  "response_quality": <float>,
  "comments": "<detailed explanation of scores, including specific examples from the itinerary>"
}}

**Error Handling**: If any input (query, preferences, itinerary) is incomplete or unclear, note the limitation in the comments and assign scores based on available information, using reasonable assumptions.
